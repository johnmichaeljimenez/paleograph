## Paleograph

A small local tool that recursively merges text files into a single prompt-friendly document for LLM review and self-evaluation.

Paleograph packages folders of text into a single context file for LLM-assisted review.
The project uses its own output to **evaluate and refine itself**, forming a simple self-improving feedback loop.

Built as a low-stakes, self-hosted utility for thinking better with LLMs — not a framework, not a product.
